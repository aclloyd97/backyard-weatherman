## Flight through a Hurricane

The flight over, for the most part, had been smooth. Looking out the window, the clouds hung low. A crack of lightning flashed across the sky--but no thunder followed. Typically I get nervous flying through a storm but today I hadn’t. The pilot kept the airplane relatively smooth and calm, considering the impending Hurricane.

Flying from Boston, MA on I was concerned that they wouldn’t let us leave for Houston, TX.[^1] The Hurricane began formation in the Gulf of Mexico a few days prior, and as it loomed closer it became projected for Houston. My flight was one of the last to land in Houston. Wanting to evacuate the personnel as soon as possible, the airport didn’t allow luggage off of the plane. As I walked through the airport, I decided that Sunday morning, maybe Sunday afternoon, I would leave to return to College Station to be there for the first day of university classes.

My dad picked me up in the 2014 Honda Civic, a small car, and we drove into the storm. Rain pelted the car at the same rate that we saw on the plane. On the ground, however, the water was much scarier. Why Dad didn’t bring the truck, I’ll never know. Lighting flashed, thunder cracked, rain poured. Dad drove us slowly through, trying to be careful of the rising water. There were times that I thought we would be the idiots stuck on the highway on the news. We made it home safely, thank goodness. I went to sleep fully expecting to leave in the morning for college.

> You see, this wasn’t my first hurricane.

### With footnotes too!

Back up your stuff with solid, clean citations. Footnotes can be written in markdown and appear like this.[^1] Use as many as you like.[^2]

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

### Add social sharing buttons

Simply add the following line anywhere in your markdown:

<pre><code>{% raw  %}
{% include sharing.html %}
{% endraw %}
</code></pre>

and get a nice responsive sharing ribbon.

Add this at the bottom, or the top, or between every other paragraph if you're deseprate for social validation.

Just remember to customize the buttons to fit your url in the `_includes/sharing.html` file. These buttons are made available and customizable by the good folks at kni-labs. See the documentation at [https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) for more information.

### Font awesome is also included

<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i> Now you can use all the cool icons you want! [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) is indeed awesome. But wait, you don't need this sweetness and you don't want that little bit of load time from the font awesome css? No problem, just disable it in the `config.yml` file, and it won't be loaded.

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>you can make lists...</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>with cool icons like this,</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>even ones that move!</li>
</ul>

If you need them, you can stick any of the [605 icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) anywhere, with any size you like. ([See documentation](http://fontawesome.io/examples/))

<i class="fa fa-building"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-bus fa-lg"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-cube fa-2x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-paper-plane fa-3x"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x">
